# Lending Case Study Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Overview
This Jupyter Notebook encompasses an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of a lending dataset. The primary aim is to analyze and understand the various features and patterns within the data related to loan lending and repayment.

## Objective
The objective of this analysis is to derive insights that can help in understanding:
- Minimizing Credit Risk
- Identifying potential risk 
- Improve Decision-making process

### Exploratory Data Analysis:
- Target Definition: Creating a binary 'target' column based on loan status
- Visualization of loan status distribution
- Distribution of columns and outlier identification
- Bivariate analysis to uncover relationships between columns and loan status
- State-wise default rate analysis
- Visualizing defaults against various categorical columns

### Feature Engineering:
- Binning numerical columns to observe trends and relationships with loan defaults.
- Examined loan amount, interest rates, and annual income to identify patterns associated with defaulters.

### Data Visualization:
- Visualization revealed patterns in loan status concerning various categorical columns, providing insights into risk factors.
